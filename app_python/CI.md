**CI Name**: Python CI

**Triggers**: The CI pipeline is triggered on push events, specifically targeting changes in the `app_python` directory.

**Job Configuration**:
- **Environment**: The CI job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- **Dependency Caching**: Dependencies are cached to speed up subsequent builds. Cache key is generated based on the contents of the `requirements.txt` file.

**Best practices**:
1. **Automate Testing**: Set up automated testing to run on every code change or commit to ensure code quality and identify issues early.

2. **Dependency Management**: Cache dependencies to speed up build times and ensure consistent environments across builds.

3. **Linting and Static Analysis**: Include linting and static code analysis tools to enforce code style, identify potential bugs, and improve code maintainability.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented unit testing.

5. **Security Checks**: Integrate security scanning tools into the CI pipeline to detect vulnerabilities and ensure code security.
