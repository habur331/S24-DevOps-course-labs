# Web Application Best Practices and Coding Standards

## Documentation

The project documentation is meticulously maintained in **Markdown (MD)** files. This strategic choice ensures that the project's documentation remains easily accessible, highly readable, and efficiently maintained within the MD files.


## PEP 8 Compliance

The **Python** code strictly adheres to the **PEP 8** style guide conventions. Consistency in indentation, variable naming, and overall code formatting is rigorously maintained, contributing to a codebase that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also promotes optimal readability.

## Code Quality

### Version Control Best Practices

**Git** is employed as the version control system, with an unwavering commitment to atomic commits. This disciplined approach to version control facilitates a seamless and efficient collaborative development process.

### Unit Testing
I have covered my main service with tests, which gives out the time depending on the time zone

#### I have followed the following best practices

- **Descriptive Test**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested, improving readability and understanding.

- **Isolation**: Each test method is independent and tests a specific aspect of the functionality in isolation, adhering to the principle of unit testing.

- **Assertions**: Assert statements are used to verify expected outcomes, ensuring the correctness of the tested functionality.

- **Test Coverage**: The tests cover various scenarios, including different timezones and checking if the current time is not in the future, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

## CI
**Triggers**: The CI pipeline is triggered on push events, specifically targeting changes in the `app_python` directory.

**Job Configuration**:
- **Environment**: The CI job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- **Dependency Caching**: Dependencies are cached to speed up subsequent builds. Cache key is generated based on the contents of the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Python Setup**: Python version 3.11 is set up using the actions/setup-python action.


## Conclusion

The web application stands as a testament to unwavering adherence to best practices and coding standards. Through rigorous testing, meticulous documentation, and strict compliance with PEP 8, the project not only delivers a robust solution but also serves as a beacon for promoting and upholding exemplary development practices.
